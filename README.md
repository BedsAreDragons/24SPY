# [ATC24 Radar](https://tiaguinho2009.github.io/ATC24-Radar/)

The purpose of this site is to display planes and ATCs currently online on the ATC24 Server, similar to Vatsim-Radar. However, the chances of this actually becoming a reality are about as low as winning the lottery! So, this project is primarily a way for me to improve my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.

In the future, if it becomes feasible, the site might genuinely work, at least to show ATC information. But that will only happen if the ATC24 staff considers my work "okay" which, honestly, seems unlikely!
But one way to make this possible is to convince the staff to do it, as there would be a lot of people who would want my website to work, but who am I to say this, the staff will look at me and say that I am a random guy.

Currently, the site is still in development, so there may be many missing features yet to be created and a lot of bugs because I'm a legend at programming as you can see ðŸ’€

## Update DEV 0.1.3

Reorganized the script, tried to improve the zoom (I think I succeeded), fixed bugs related to showing the ATCs Online.
And as you've already noticed that I'm incredible, I managed to make the button that shows the Online CTRs stop working in an attempt to improve them, I'm still trying to figure out what I went wrong in the middle, but it should be resolved in the next update (I put the update online with this error anyway because the function of that button was not crucial for the site to work and it is not crashing the site either XD)
